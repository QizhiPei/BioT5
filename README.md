## News
**Oct 11 2023**: Initial commits. More codes, pre-trained model, and data are coming soon.

## Setup Environment
This is an example for how to set up a working conda environment to run the code.
```
git clone https://github.com/QizhiPei/BioT5.git
cd BioT5
conda create -n biot5 python=3.8
conda activate biot5
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data
Coming soon...

## Pre-trained Models

|Model|Description|Huggingface Checkpoint|
|----|----|---|
|BioT5|Pre-trained BioT5||
|BioT5-Molecule Captioning|Fine-tuned BioT5 for molecule captioning task on ChEBI-20||
|BioT5-Text Based Molecule Generation|Fine-tuned BioT5 for text based molecule generation task on ChEBI-20||
|BioT5-PPI|Fine-tuned BioT5 for protein-protein interaction task on PEER benchmark||
|BioT5-DTI|Fine-tuned BioT5 for drug-target interaction task on PEER benchmark||
|BioT5-P|Fine-tuned BioT5 for protein property prediction task on PEER benchmark||


## Fine-tuning
Take the DTI task finetuning as an example:
```
bash finetune.sh ft_dti
```
Change the `ft_dti` to other file names in `biot5/configs/task` to fine-tune on other downstream tasks.
